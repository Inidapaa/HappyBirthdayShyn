          </p>
          <div class="pesan">
            <p class="p2.1">
              When I say I miss u, I don’t mean it in some sad miserable way,
              but in a say that honors that connection we had. Not in some
              regretful way, or not even in some way that says I wanna see u
              again, but I just truly miss u.
            </p>
            <p class="p2.2">
              This isn’t a: I wanna be friends again... <br />Or even a: I want
              u in my life again… <br />Because I know that we both know deep in
              our hearts that we aren’t meant to be, and that’s okay.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
              I’m sure u know me though, and that I wasn’t going to lose either,
              so I chose for both of us to win. I think that was the lesson for
              the love. It was a love I could never beat.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
              U were never my sad ending; u were just not my ending. <br />Don’t
              get me wrong though; I’m glad I got to play a role in your story,
              <br />even if it wasn’t meant to be lasting one,, and for the
              record, I’m glad u did too.
            </p>
            <p class="p4">
              So one day, when u walk down the aisle, and complete the great
              love story that’s yours. I hope u remember that “I am glad to see
              u win”. <br />How could I claim to be on the side of love if I
              can’t even support it in someone I love? Right?... <br />I’m glad
              we didn’t work out and I really am so happy for the both of us.
            </p>
            <p class="p7">
              I know I said that our connection was short, but it really wasn’t.
              <br />
              I think the moments we spent together were infinite, because I
              always loved u as if it was my last day on earth, and never held
              anything back. <br />From my perspective, I got to love u for a
              lifetime, and that will always be enough.
            </p>
            <p class="p8">
              This isn’t coming from a negative place, and u aren’t the only
              thing in my mind anymore… But there are moments which I steal away
              and think,,, wow… U would have loved to see this.
            </p>
            <p class="p9">
              And as tragic as our story was, I hope u know that; every memory
              of us has infinite value of me. I will love and cherish every
              single experience we had, but also honor that memory, by moving
              forward with acceptance.
            </p>
            <p class="p10">
              U really are living proof that love is never wasted. I now say
              goodbye with a full and complete heart. Thank u for this
              experience.
            </p>
            <p class="p10">I know we are better for it…</p>
            <p class="penutup">Genuinely with love, Goodbye.❤️</p>
